# Real-time Stocks with PHP and JavaScript

You are looking at a **real-time stock** app that sends data from a
**PHP Server Script** to an **HTML5 JavaScript** app.
Data is broadcast from the PHP Server and the HTML5 JavaScript app
will receive the data and display it in real-time.

Each stock quote symbol may be subscribed individually or as a group.
This means that you are receiving only the data that you need and
are interested in, saving on bandwidth.
